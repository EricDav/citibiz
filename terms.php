			<p class="font-weight-light pl-sm-4 mb-2">If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
				middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary</p>
			<p class="font-weight-light pl-sm-4 mb-2">first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
				structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
				injected humour</p>

			<h6 class="my-md-4 my-3">Account & Registration</h6>
			<p class="font-weight-light pl-sm-4 mb-2">Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
				by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
				first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
			<p class="font-weight-light pl-sm-4 mb-2">Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
				a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
